# Java Snake
First attempt to create Snake. Used a grid system to dictate food placement and snake segment placement/movement.

## Context
This was one of my first projects. I had just learned Java and its Swing library, and wanted to try making a game. At first, I didn't realize that Snake was built on a grid, so I was moving the snake pixel by pixel, but quickly realized the problems that came with it. Eventually I figured out how a grid would be much simpler, so I implemented it using a grid.

## How to Run
Given this was one of my first projects, I was not sure how to package the Java files, so currently the only way to run this would be to open the project in Intellij and run `Game.java`.
